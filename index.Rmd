# This is called Open Science. 
## Open research aims to transform research by making it more reproducible, transparent, reusable, collaborative, accountable, and accessible to society. It pushes for change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools.

## In this workshop, you'll learn:

--

#### How vrsion control system can be leveraged as an electronic lab notebook for computational work

--

#### Learn why adding licensing information to a repository is important, and how to choose a proper license

--

#### Make your work easy to cite

## What now?

You can easily contributing to open-source, improve employability

You will learn programming and coding, have others review your code.

You will not be (useless) data scientist 

You will start build tools and packages

## In line with vision 2030, we are starting an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia.
## It's created and developed with the help of the "Open Life Sciences"
<img src="figs/open-lif-sci-logo.jpeg">

Open Life Sciences (OLS3) program helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors.

We want to provide a place where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia.
