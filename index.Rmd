# This is called Open Science. 
## Open Science is about extending the principles of openness to the whole research cycle, fostering sharing and collaboration as early as possible thus entailing a systemic change to the way science and research is done

## In line with vision 2030, we are starting an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia.
## It's created and developed with the help of the "Open Life Sciences"

Open Life Sciences (OLS3) program helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors.

We want to provide a place where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia.
